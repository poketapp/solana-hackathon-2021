# Solana Hackathon

This project uses Solana to allow users to create "tasks" for other users to "complete" and, in turn, get rewarded

The project comprises of:

* An on-chain program to create and complete tasks
* A client that can create a task

## Quick Start

The following dependencies are required to build and run this example, depending
on your OS, they may already be installed:

- Install node (v14 recommended)
- Install npm
- Install the latest Rust stable from https://rustup.rs/
- Install Solana v1.7.11 or later from
  https://docs.solana.com/cli/install-solana-cli-tools

If this is your first time using Rust, these [Installation
Notes](README-installation-notes.md) might be helpful.

### Configure CLI

> If you're on Windows, it is recommended to use [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) to run these commands

1. Set CLI config url to localhost cluster

```bash
solana config set --url localhost
```

2. Create CLI Keypair

If this is your first time using the Solana CLI, you will need to generate a new keypair:

```bash
solana-keygen new
```

### Start local Solana cluster

This example connects to a local Solana cluster by default.

Start a local Solana cluster:
```bash
solana-test-validator
```
> **Note**: You may need to do some [system tuning](https://docs.solana.com/running-validator/validator-start#system-tuning) (and restart your computer) to get the validator to run

Listen to transaction logs:
```bash
solana logs
```

### Install npm dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### Build the on-chain program

```bash
npm run build:program-rust
```

### Deploy the on-chain program

```bash
solana program deploy dist/program/helloworld.so
```

### Start the server

```bash
cd src/server
nodemon server.js
```

### Client to create a task
```bash
cd src/admin
npm install
ng serve --port 8080
```

### Client to complete a task
Please refer to https://github.com/poketapp/solana-react

### Entrypoint

The [client's
entrypoint](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/main.ts#L13)
does five things.

### Establish a connection to the cluster

The client establishes a connection with the cluster by calling
[`establishConnection`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L92).

### Establish an account to pay for transactions

The client ensures there is an account available to pay for transactions,
and creates one if there is not, by calling
[`establishPayer`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L102).

### Check if the on-chain program has been deployed

In [`checkProgram`](https://github.com/solana-labs/example-helloworld/blob/ad52dc719cdc96d45ad8e308e8759abf4792b667/src/client/hello_world.ts#L144),
the client loads the keypair of the deployed program from `./dist/program/helloworld-keypair.json` and uses
the public key for the keypair to fetch the program account. If the program doesn't exist, the client halts
with an error. If the program does exist, it will create a new account with the program assigned as its owner
to store program state (number of hello's processed).

### Create a task on the on-chain program

The client then constructs and sends a "Task" transaction to the program by
calling

### Query the task

The client then reads the task
